**Correct Option**: a) O(1)  
**Explanation**: In a circular queue, the enqueue operation can be done in constant time, O(1), since we use the modulo operation to wrap around the queue when the rear reaches the end.

a) Using a counter for the number of elements in the queue.  
b) Using a dynamic array for resizing.
