   - **Answer: d**  
   **Explanation:** All listed options are fundamental features of OOP. 

2. **What does the term "encapsulation" refer to in OOP?**
   - **a) Hiding implementation details** - Correct; encapsulation is about hiding the internal state and requiring all interaction to be performed through an object's methods.
   - **b) Sharing code across classes** - This relates to inheritance, not encapsulation.
   - **c) Defining a blueprint for an object** - This describes classes.
   - **d) Creating subclasses** - This refers to inheritance.
   - **Answer: a**  
   **Explanation:** Encapsulation protects the state of an object by restricting access to its internal representation.

3. **What is the purpose of a constructor in a class?**
   - **a) To destroy an object** - This describes a destructor.
   - **b) To initialize an object** - Correct; constructors are called when an instance of a class is created to set initial values.
   - **c) To create a class** - This is incorrect; a class is defined independently.
   - **d) To modify an object** - This is typically done by setter methods, not constructors.
   - **Answer: b**  
   **Explanation:** Constructors are special methods used to initialize objects of a class.

4. **Which of the following is an example of inheritance?**
   - **a) A method in a class** - This does not illustrate inheritance.

   - **c) A variable defined within a class** - This does not represent inheritance.
   - **d) None of the above** - Incorrect since option b is valid.
   - **Answer: b**  
   **Explanation:** Inheritance allows a class (subclass) to use properties and methods of another class (superclass).

5. **What is polymorphism in OOP?**
   - **a) The ability to present the same interface for different underlying forms** - Correct; polymorphism allows methods to operate on objects of different classes through the same interface.
   - **b) Creating multiple classes** - This describes classes, not polymorphism.
   - **c) Hiding object data** - This is encapsulation.
   - **d) None of the above** - Incorrect because option a is valid.

   **Answer: d**  
   **Explanation:** Polymorphism allows methods to be defined in different forms, either through method overriding, overloading, or accepting different data types.

---

**4. In which of the following scenarios would you use composition?**
   - a) When objects exist independently
   - b) When one class contains another class and depends on it
   - c) When two classes share some methods
   - d) When creating an interface  
   **Answer: b**  
   **Explanation:** Composition is used when a class contains references to objects of another class, indicating a strong relationship where the contained objects cannot exist independently.

---

**5. What is the purpose of inheritance in OOP?**
   - a) To allow a new class to inherit properties and methods from an existing class
   - b) To hide the implementation details of a class
   - c) To manage object states

   - b) By enforcing a single implementation of methods
   - c) By requiring all classes to implement the same methods
   - d) By preventing method overriding  
   **Answer: a**  
   **Explanation:** Polymorphism enhances flexibility by allowing objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, facilitating dynamic method binding.

---

**11. What does an abstract class in OOP typically contain?**
   - a) Only abstract methods
   - b) Only concrete methods
   - c) Both abstract and concrete methods
   - d) No methods at all  
   **Answer: c**
